Blender G3D Exporter
====================

This is an addon for the Blender 3D modeling tool (http://www.blender.org). The purpose of this addon is to allow Blender to export 3D models as G3DJ files (G3D models written as JSON objects).

G3D is a custom 3D model file format compatible with the LibGDX framework (http://http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/). The format is easy enough to allow use for other frameworks and is powerfull enough to support most features for game development, like multiple materials, multiple textures, different kinds of textures (diffuse maps, normal maps, etc.) and even animations.

This addon is currently compatible with Blender v2.69. I can't garantee compatibility with previous or future versions, but I'll try to update it if future Blender updates break compatibility.
